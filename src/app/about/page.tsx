      My name is Samuel and I was born on La Palma and lived there until I was
      18 years old, when I moved to study abroad. I currently live and work in
      Sweden. In 2021, a year after I finished Casa Julio and started renting it
      in El Para√≠so, the Tajogaite volcano erupted and destroyed my family's
      houses and Casa Julio. In 2023 I bought this old house and renovated it
      completely together with my dad during 7 months. Casa Atlante has become a
      very special place for me. It is a sea of tranquility, a place to
      disconnect and enjoy La Palma's breathtaking nature.
