        Casa Atlante is a beautiful ocean view holiday rental home, situated on
        the sunny west of the island of La Palma, in the Jedey neighbourhood.
        The house is on-grid solar-powered and fully-equipped. The 46 m2 of the
        interior will make you feel comfortably at home whether you are a group
        or a couple. The house was completely renovated in 2023 and all the
        appliances are new. From the large terrace you can enjoy an all-day-long
        sun with stunning views to the sea and the Cumbre Vieja Natural Park,
        and some of the most beautiful sunsets and star-gazing views. The
        surrounding areas to the house are left in its natural state with plants
        of the area.
