      Casa Atlante's unique location in the Red Natura 2000 of Tamanca area on
      the west side of La Palma makes it perfect for those who love the mountain
      and the beach. The area is a sea of tranquility and many hiking trails can
      be accessed easily by feet from the house. The house was completely
      renovated in 2023 and all the appliances are new. A 40/5 mbps Internet
      connection is available by both WiFi and Ethernet ports so for those
      working remotely.
