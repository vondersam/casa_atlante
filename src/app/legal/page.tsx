      <h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        This website uses technical cookies (small files with information that
        the server sends to the computer of the website user) in order to carry
        out certain functions considered necessary for the correct functioning
        and preview of the website. In any case, the cookies used are temporary,
        with the sole purpose of making navigation of the site more efficient,
        and disappear at the end of the user’s session. Under no circumstances
        do these cookies themselves provide personal data and will not be used
        for the collection of such data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through using cookies, it is also possible for the server where the
        website is located to recognise the browser used by the user in order to
        make navigation easier, allowing, for example, users who have previously
        registered to access the areas, services, promotions or contests
        reserved exclusively for them without having to register on each visit.
        They may also be used to measure the audience or traffic parameters,
        monitor the progress and number of entries, etc. In these cases, the
        cookies used are technically non-essential but beneficial to the user.
        This website will not install non-essential cookies without previous
        user consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser may be configured by the user to alert them of the reception
        of cookies and to prevent their installation on their computer. For
        further information, please consult the instructions of your browser.
      </p>
      <h3>Link policy</h3>
      <p>
        The user of this website may be redirected to content from third party
        websites. Since the CONTROLLER cannot always control the contents of
        third party websites, they do not assume any type of responsibility with
        respect to said contents. In any case, the CONTROLLER will immediately
        remove any content that may be in breach of national or international
        laws, morality or public order, and will immediately remove the
        redirection to this website, informing the competent authorities of the
        content in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CONTROLLER will not be responsible for the information and content
        found, including but not limited to, in forums, chats, blog generators,
        comments, social networks or any other means that allows third parties
        to publish content independently on the website of the CONTROLLER.
        However, and in accordance with Acts 11 and 16 of the LSSICE, third
        party content is made available to all users, authorities, and law
        enforcement bodies collaborating directly on the withdrawal or blocking
        of all content that may affect or violate national or international law,
        third party rights or public morals and public order. In the event that
        the user considers there to be any content on the website that could be
        considered as such, please notify the website administrator immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website was revised and tested to enable its correct functioning.
        In principle, proper functioning can be guaranteed 365 days a year, 24
        hours a day. However, the CONTROLLER does not rule out the possibility
        of there being certain programming errors, or that force majeure,
        natural disasters, strikes or similar circumstances may occur that make
        accessing the website impossible.
      </p>
      <h3>IP Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        The website servers can detect automatically the IP address and the
        domain name used by the user. An IP address is a number assigned
        automatically to a computer when connected to the Internet. All of this
        information is recorded in a system log on the server that allows the
        subsequent processing of the data in order to obtain only statistical
        measurements that show us the number of page hits, the number of visits
        made to the web servers, the order of visits, the access point, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>4. APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION</h3>
      <p>
        Spanish legislation shall apply to the resolution of all disputes or
        questions related to this website or the activities carried out therein,
        to which the parties expressly submit themselves, and the Courts and
        Tribunals of the USER’s domicile or the place of fulfilment of the
        obligation shall be competent for the resolution of all disputes arising
        from or related to its use.
